# News Summarizer
By Jeffrey Lee

This program is able to pull the latest news from The Guardian, extract the article text, and summarize it to 10% of its total sentences. Once the summaries are generated, they are written to a simple HTML page in an easily readable format. It is the bare bones of an automated news summary website, and is a strong introduction to using natural language processing to score and rank sentences by importance.

The language processing is done via GATE applications, with the sentence scoring being done by the SUMMA text summarization plugin. UPF provided resources with useful stop words in both English and Spanish to improve the accuracy of sentence rankings and make the program bilingual.

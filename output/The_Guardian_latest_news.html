<h2> <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/03/liam-fox-extending-article-50-may-be-only-option-for-a-smooth-brexit>ERG warns May not to 'bounce' parliament over new Brexit deal</a> </h2> 
<h3>Jessica Elgot, Daniel Boffey in Brussels and Emily Schultheis in Berlin: Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.07 GMT </h3>Tory Brexiters are to demand at least two days to scrutinise any new offer from Brussels on the backstop mechanism, warning the prime minister not to “bounce” the group into an early vote on her Brexit deal.
The so-called “star chamber” of Brexiters who will pass judgment on the compromise will be chaired by the veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash and also includes the DUP’s Nigel Dodds, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, former DExEU minister David Jones, the backbenchers Michael Tomlinson and Robert Courts, both former barristers, and Martin Howe QC, chair of the pro-leave group Lawyers for Britain.
Over the weekend, Michel Barnier , the EU’s chief negotiator, suggested in an interview with European newspapers that Theresa May would need to delay Brexit even if she got her deal through parliament in mid-March.
Barnier told ambassadors on Friday that he would be meeting the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Geoffrey Cox next Tuesday to work on an “interpretative” document to reassure MPs on the temporary nature of the Irish backstop but without a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism.

<h3>Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.48 GMT</h3>The targets include the president’s son Donald Trump Jr and the chief finance officer of Trump’s business empire, Allen Weisselberg, both of whom have been implicated in payments made to an adult film actor on Trump’s behalf in violation of campaign finance laws.
He said it was one of 12 installments reimbursing him for the $130,000 payment he had made to Daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election to keep her from going public over an alleged affair with Trump Sr – a payment that was a criminal violation of campaign finance laws that has in part sent Cohen to prison.
Cohen provided an account of overhearing a whispered conversation between Trump and Don Jr that suggested the elder Trump had prior knowledge of the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a group of Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton.
The third area of investigation prompted by Cohen’s hearing related to Trump’s financial dealings, particularly over plans to build a Trump tower in Moscow that were under discussion during the 2016 election.

<h3>Peter Walker and Josh Halliday: Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.53 GMT</h3>A surge in Ukip membership is shifting the party decisively towards the far right, as long-standing moderates are replaced by entrants attracted by an anti-Islam agenda based on street protest, a Guardian investigation can reveal.
Conversations with more than two dozen current and former Ukip figures, many of them senior, have uncovered an exodus of more moderate senior members and local organisers, hollowing out Ukip’s ability to fight future elections.
Members of Ukip’s youth wing have posted antisemitic and other extremist messages online, and there has been a rise in the popularity of news websites pushing the party’s message.
Analysts warn that with Ukip’s poll numbers rising amid the continued deadlock over Brexit there is a danger the party could soon be reinvented as a street movement, becoming the first significant far-right force in UK politics since the demise of the British National party (BNP).
And while Ukip has publicly sought to reject links to the yellow-vest protesters who have harassed politicians and journalists outside parliament and have links to far-right and anti-Islam views , their main Facebook page is run by Martin Costello, the chair of Ukip’s Wiltshire branch and a former parliamentary candidate.

<h3>Reuters: Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.00 GMT</h3>﻿The US has said it is trying to find out whether Pakistan used US-built F-16 jets to down an Indian warplane, potentially in violation of trade agreements, as the standoff between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours showed signs of easing.
The US embassy in Islamabad said on Sunday it was looking into reports that Pakistan used F-16 jets to shoot down the Indian pilot, a potential violation of Washington’s military sale agreements that limit how Pakistan can use the planes.
On Thursday, Indian officials displayed to reporters parts of what they called an air-to-air missile that can only be fired from F-16 jets, alleging they were used to bomb its side of the disputed Kashmir border on Wednesday.

<h3>Angela Giuffrida in Rome: Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.04 GMT</h3>Voters took to the polls on Sunday to elect a new leader to represent Italy’s centre-left Democratic party, as the embattled group strives to re-establish itself as a credible force against the country’s rightwing populist government.
Nicola Zingaretti, the president of the Lazio region, is widely tipped to win, but he will need to eclipse 50% of the vote in order to secure the leadership.
Polls on Friday put Zingaretti ahead with 47.38%, followed by Maurizio Martina, the party’s former caretaker leader, with 38%, and Roberto Giachetti with 11%.
Giuseppe DeFinis, who also backed Zingaretti, said he voted “because the danger to Italy is Salvini”.

<h3>Ruth Michaelson: Sun 3 Mar 2019 18.11 GMT</h3>Bouteflika has made few public appearances or speeches since suffering a stroke in 2013, fuelling speculation that the country is effectively run by his brother and adviser Saïd, the head of the military, Ahmed Gaïd Salah, and a cabal of opaque political and military officials known as le pouvoir, or “the power”.
Rumours have been rife that the Algerian elite would seek to replace Bouteflika with another candidate to ensure the long-term survival of the regime he has headed since 1999, but there was little to suggest on the day of the deadline that the president and his entourage would cede to the demands of the protesters.
“For months, there’s been speculation that the elites would make some kind of effort to find a successor to Bouteflika, but the announcement that he would run again was widely interpreted as a sign of a failure to do so,” said Stephen McInerney of the Washington-based thinkthank Project on Middle East Democracy.

<h3>Lauren Gambino: Sun 3 Mar 2019 14.15 GMT</h3>With the Chicago skyline around him, Bernie Sanders will on Sunday conclude his two-part presidential campaign launch by emphasizing the role of race and racial discrimination in American society.
Sanders is attempting to build a new kind of campaign, one that seeks to address the weaknesses of his 2016 run by expanding his appeal to nonwhite voters.
On a recent visit to South Carolina, an early voting state where black voters made up about roughly 60% of the Democratic primary vote in 2016, Sanders attempted to reset his message, declaring that “racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality”.
“History defines him,” Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who is a co-chair of Sanders’ campaign, said in Brooklyn.

<h3>Agence France-Presse in Tallinn: Sun 3 Mar 2019 17.19 GMT</h3>Estonia’s centre-left coalition is fighting for survival at the country’s general election, in a battle against traditional liberal rivals and a surging far-right party buoyed by a backlash from rural voters.
Both strongly support Estonia’s EU and Nato membership and have favoured austerity to keep spending in check, giving the country the eurozone’s lowest debt-to-GDP ratio.
Staunchly Eurosceptic, EKRE called for a referendum on Estonia’s EU membership, although the move would be doomed to fail in the overwhelmingly pro-EU country.

<h3>Nazia Parveen, North of England correspondent: Sun 3 Mar 2019 15.47 GMT</h3>A six-year-old girl who has spent her entire life inside a Pakistani prison after her British mother was convicted of drug trafficking has been released and returned to the UK.
Khadija Shah, 32, gave birth to her daughter Malaika while serving a life sentence inside the notorious Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, in the Punjab province.
During her time in prison, Shah has continually protested her innocence and claims she was asked to take the cases during a stay in an Islamabad guesthouse.
Shah has been supported by the British legal charity Reprieve and was let out of prison for a day to give birth to Malaika.
